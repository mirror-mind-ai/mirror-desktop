# CV-010.DS-005 - Speak to the TypeScript Core Without Breaking the Python One

**Status:** 🟡 Planned — selected by the Navigator on 2026-10-28 (path b); nothing built

## Outcome

Mirror Desktop works with Mirror Core 0.32+ (TypeScript, installed with `npm install -g mirror-mind`,
run as `mirror …`) **in addition to** Mirror Core 0.31.x (Python checkout run through `uv`). The
Navigator's production installation, bound to Python 0.31.14, keeps working through every release of
this Delivery Story without any change on their side.

Numbered DS-005 because DS-002 to DS-004 were already named; it is **the first to be built**, since
every later slice installs or talks to the Core that is published today.

## Why

Field, 2026-10-28: following mirrormind.sh in the clean `mirror` account, `uv sync` failed because
published Mirror is TypeScript 0.37.0. Every Desktop release supports only `>=0.31.14,<0.32.0`, so a
person installing Mirror today cannot use Mirror Desktop, and DS-001 cannot find their Mirror.

## The Constraint That Shapes Everything

> The current Mirror Desktop installation must not stop working: it holds this session and several
> others. — Navigator, 2026-10-28

What production depends on, measured:

- `runtime-binding.v1.json`: `alisson-vale`, `/Users/alissonvale/mirror`, Python **0.31.14** on `stable`
  at `b2d710e`. Upstream `stable` has moved to 0.37.0.
- Nothing updates that checkout automatically: no LaunchAgent runs a Mirror update. The one Mirror
  LaunchAgent (`mirror-web-console`) itself runs `uv run python -m memory web`, so it also depends on
  the Python Core staying.
- What changes production is a Desktop release the Navigator chooses to install.

### Invariants for every release of this story

1. **Additive, never replacing.** The Python path is not removed or rewritten. A binding written by an
   earlier release is read exactly as before, with no migration and no rewrite of the file.
2. **The Core kind is decided by what is installed, never by a guess.** It is a checkout with
   `src/memory` (Python) or a `mirror` front door (TypeScript), and an existing binding keeps its kind.
3. **A production-shaped regression guard.** A fixture with the shape of the production binding
   (Python checkout, 0.31.14, `uv`) must validate, connect and produce the same argv for all six Core
   calls as today. Any diff is a failed gate.
4. **Built and proven away from production.** Development uses the Development channel, which has its
   own bundle identifier and app data, and the clean `mirror` account. Production is upgraded only
   after both pass, and only by the Navigator.
5. **A rollback the Navigator holds.** Before the production upgrade, a copy of the running alpha.58
   app is kept outside `/Applications`. Going back is then putting it back, and the binding file it
   reads is untouched by design.
6. **The Navigator's own Mirror is not migrated by this story.** Moving production to TypeScript Core
   is a separate, later and explicit decision, and the web console depends on Python as well.

## What Desktop Calls Today (to map onto 0.37)

| Today (Python) | Where | 0.37 equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `uv run python -m memory conversations append --mirror-home … --format json` | outbox delivery (CR163 bounded) | `mirror conversations append`, **documented** |
| `… -m memory journey mutate` | Journey admin | to confirm |
| `… -m memory journey-projection inspect` | Canvas/Tactical | to confirm |
| `… -m memory recall` | terminal recall launcher | `/mm-recall` documented; CLI form to confirm |
| `scripts/mirror_conversation_catalog.py` (**imports `memory.MemoryClient`**) | catalog, rebind-journey | **no Python API in 0.37**: needs a CLI equivalent, or the operation stays Python-only |
| `scripts/provision_mirror_conversation.py` (**imports `memory.MemoryClient`**) | conversation provisioning | same |

The two scripts that import Core's Python API are the real risk. If 0.37 offers no command for
provisioning and catalogue operations, Desktop cannot provision a Conversation on TypeScript Core
without changing Core, and that conflicts with the Navigator's rule. **This must be answered before
any code is written.**

## Step 1 — Compatibility Audit (read-only)

- Install `mirror-mind@0.37.0` in a scratch prefix in the `mirror` account, or read the published
  package. Do not touch the production checkout.
- For each row above, find the 0.37 command, its arguments and JSON shape, and record it next to
  today's.
- Confirm where 0.37 resolves the home: a clone's `.env`, then `~/.config/mirror/env`, per its
  Getting Started. Also confirm the database file name.
- **Deliverable:** this table filled in, with every gap named and a recommendation. Each gap gets one
  of three answers: a 0.37 command exists, the operation degrades on TypeScript Core, or it needs Core
  (which would go back to the Navigator).

Scope, files, acceptance and validation are written after the audit, because they depend on its gaps.

## Exclusions

- Migrating the Navigator's Mirror to TypeScript Core, or updating `/Users/alissonvale/mirror`.
- Removing Python Core support.
- Changing Mirror Core, or the site's install page, which belongs to another Journey.
